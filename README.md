# Was it Fare?

-	Purpose: To show differences among many different levels concerning rides.  Discussed will be the micro points of the driver, riders, fares and the ultimate difference of the previously stated points in the macro view of the cities they occur in.

      	Urban – $19,356.33;
      	Suburban – $39,854.38;

## Summary

-	The following are my personal recommendations to the CEO of PyBer:	
    
    1.	The information given is pretty useful and in-depth, but I think it is missing a key piece of information.  The number of fares dropped/cancelled.  Even though it’s a           negative piece of information its still useful and gaining further insight on the efficiency of the company.  
    
    2.	Based strictly off the given information, I would say a more solid push into the rural sector should be made.  Rural fare is a lot higher but according to the                   information given rural fares were the least experience fare type (see ATTACH PICTURE INFO) Rural rides stands at only 5.3% overall. The next being 26.3%

    3.	Lastly, to accomplish the previous suggestion I would also suggest doing a sub-massive hiring in the rural sector for drivers.  Not only were the fares the lowest in the         rural sector but so is the amount of drivers there too. (see ATTACH PICTURE INFO)
